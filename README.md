Welcome!
========

This project is designed to help me port the wonderful [ruby-warrior](http://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior) to Clojure (a.k.a. [clonan](http://github.com/seth-schroeder/clojure-warrior)).

Solutions to several ruby-warrior levels can be found here. The quality is suspect, I guarantee it. Using these to cheat is really a failure-with-frosting. Still, if you are looking for the README for each level by all means enjoy.
